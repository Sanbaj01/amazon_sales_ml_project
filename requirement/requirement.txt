Project Summary:
This project aims to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an Amazon sales dataset and subsequently build a price prediction model. The dataset contains information about various products sold on Amazon, including features such as product category, ratings, reviews, shipping details, and prices.

Objectives:

Data Exploration: The primary objective is to gain insights into the dataset by performing EDA. This includes understanding the distribution of product categories, analyzing customer reviews and ratings, and exploring any potential correlations between variables.

Data Preprocessing: Prepare the dataset for modeling by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical variables if necessary.

Feature Engineering: Create relevant features that may enhance the predictive power of the model, such as extracting text features from product descriptions or aggregating historical sales data.

Model Building: Develop a machine learning model to predict product prices. Experiment with various algorithms like linear regression, random forest, or gradient boosting to find the best-performing model.

Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) score.

Price Prediction: Utilize the trained model to make price predictions for new products or those not present in the dataset. Monitor the model's accuracy and make necessary improvements.

Documentation: Maintain a detailed README file to provide a clear overview of the project, including its objectives, dataset description, methodology, and key findings.

Steps:

Data Collection: Gather the Amazon sales dataset, ensuring it includes relevant information such as product details, reviews, ratings, and prices.

Data Cleaning: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing any outliers that might affect the analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to visualize and understand the dataset's characteristics. Generate plots and summary statistics to identify patterns and trends.

Data Preprocessing: Prepare the dataset for modeling by encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and splitting it into training and testing sets.

Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to improve the model's predictive capabilities.

Model Selection: Choose suitable machine learning algorithms for price prediction and train multiple models.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate each model's performance using relevant metrics and select the best-performing one.

Price Prediction: Utilize the chosen model to make price predictions for new products or for testing its accuracy on a subset of the dataset.

Documentation: Write a comprehensive README file summarizing the project, its objectives, data sources, methodology, and key findings. Include code documentation and instructions for replicating the analysis.

Conclusion and Future Work: Summarize the project's outcomes, discuss any limitations, and outline potential future improvements or extensions to the analysis.

By following these steps, you will be able to conduct a thorough analysis of the Amazon sales dataset and build a reliable price prediction model, providing valuable insights into the dataset and enhancing your data science skills.
